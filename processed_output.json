But an issue arises when a deeply nested child requires data from a component higher up in the tree. If we pass on the data through the props, every single one of the children would be required to accept the data and pass it on to its child, leading to prop drilling, a terrible practice in the world of React. To solve the prop drilling issue, we have State Management Solutions like Context API and Redux. But which one of them is best suited for your application? Today we are going to answer this age-old question! Let's check the official documentation: In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Context API is a built-in React tool that does not influence the final bundle size, and is integrated by design. To use the Context API, you have to: Create the Context const Context = createContext(MockData); Create a Provider for the Context const Parent = () => {\n    return (\n        <Context.Provider value={initialValue}>\n            <Children/>\n        </Context.Provider>\n    )\n} Consume the data in the Context const Child = () => {\n    const contextData = useContext(Context);\n    // use the data\n    // ...\n} Of course, let's head over to the documentation: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.\nIt helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger.\nYou can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available. Redux is an Open Source Library which provides a central store, and actions to modify the store. It can be used with any project using JavaScript or TypeScript, but since we are comparing it to Context API, so we will stick to React-based Applications. To use Redux you need to: Create a Reducer import { createSlice } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\";\n\nexport const slice = createSlice({\n    name: \"slice-name\",\n    initialState: {\n        // ...\n    },\n    reducers: {\n        func01: (state) => {\n            // ...\n        },\n    }\n});\n\nexport const { func01 } = slice.actions;\nexport default slice.reducer; Configure the Store import { configureStore } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\";\nimport reducer from \"./reducer\";\n\nexport default configureStore({\n    reducer: {\n        reducer: reducer\n    }\n}); Make the Store available for data consumption import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport App from './App.jsx'\nimport store from './store';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <Provider store={store}>\n        <App />\n    </Provider>,\n    document.getElementById(\"root\")\n); Use State or Dispatch Actions import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\nimport { func01 } from './redux/reducer';\n\nconst Component = () => {\n    const reducerState = useSelector((state) => state.reducer);\n    const dispatch = useDispatch();\n    const doSomething = () = > dispatch(func01)  \n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* ... */}\n        </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Component; That's all Phew! As you can see, Redux requires way more work to get it set up. From the table, you must be able to comprehend where the popular opinion Redux is for large projects & Context API for small ones come from. Both are excellent tools for their own specific niche, Redux is overkill just to pass data from parent to child & Context API truly shines in this case. When you have a lot of dynamic data Redux got your back! So you no longer have to that guy who goes: In this article, we went through what is Redux and Context API and their differences. We learned, Context API is a light-weight solution which is more suited for passing data from a parent to a deeply nested child and Redux is a more robust State Management solution. Happy Developing!

I am a beginner, how should I learn Front-End Web Dev?\nLook into the following articles: Would you mentor me?\nSorry, I am already under a lot of workload and would not have the time to mentor anyone. Context API is too complicated. I can simply import MockData from './mockData' and use it in any component. Context API has 10 lines, import only 1 line. Then you can write another blog post Redux vs. ES6 import. There are maybe projects which And then there are devs reading blogs about using redux is too complicated and end up introducing their own concepts and ideas around the Context API without knowing one thing about immutable data optimizations and so on. You can use a react context to solve problems that are also being solved by redux, but some features and optimizations are not that easy for homegrown solutions. I mean try it out - it's a great exercise to understand why you should maybe use redux in your production code or stick to a simpler solution that has less features at all. I'm not saying, that you should use redux in every project, but redux is not just some stupid boilerplate around the Context API => if you need global state utils check out the libs built for it. There are also others than redux. Redux used to be my first choice for large applications but these days I much prefer to use the Context API. Still good to know Redux though just in case and many projects and companies still require you to know it. Hello, I have developed a library, react-context-slices which allows to manage state through Context easily and quickly. It has 0 boilerplate. You can define slices of Context and fetch them with a unique hook, useSlice, which acts either as a useState or useReducer hook, depending on if you defined a reducer or not for the slice of Context you are fetching. Also, if you need to maintain some sort of complex state for any mid-level project, you can still create your own reducer using React's Context API itself, before reaching out for redux and adding external dependencies to your project initially. But you might take a performance hit. Redux seems to be better performance-wise when you intend to update the shared data a lot - see stackoverflow.com/a/66972857/7677851. If used correctly that is. One of the best and most overlooked alternatives to Redux is to use React's own built-in Context API. Context API provides a different approach to tackling the data flow problem between React‚Äôs deeply nested components. Context has been around with React for quite a while, but it has changed significantly since its inception. Up to version 16.3, it was a way to handle the state data outside the React component tree. It was an experimental feature not recommended for most use cases. Initially, the problem with legacy context was that updates to values that were passed down with context could be ‚Äúblocked‚Äù if a component skipped rendering through the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method. Since many components relied on shouldComponentUpdate for performance optimizations, the legacy context was useless for passing down plain data. The new version of Context API is a dependency injection mechanism that allows passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. The most important thing here is that, unlike Redux, Context API is not a state management system. Instead, it‚Äôs a dependency injection mechanism where you manage a state in a React component. We get a state management system when using it with useContext and useReducer hooks. A great next step to learning more is to read this article by Andy Fernandez: scalablepath.com/react/context-api... Can you give me some explanation to what you meant when you wrote Context is DI. Exciting topic! üöÄ I love exploring the nuances of state management in React, and finding the sweet spot between Redux and Context API for optimal performance and simplicity. What factors do you prioritize when making the choice? ü§î I found Redux to be easier to setup and work with than Context API. I migrated a library I was building in Redux to context API and reused most of the reducer logic, but the amount of optimization and debugging I had to do to make the same functionality work was a nightmare in Context. It made me appreciate Redux more and I switched back to save time. It was a good learning to know the specific use case and limitations of context. I too am a huge fan of redux for most projects!

Modern Redux looks very differently and is about 1/4 of the code. It does not use switch..case reducers, ACTION_TYPES or createStore and is a lot easier to set up than what you are used to.\nI'd highly recommend going through the official Redux tutorial and maybe updating this article afterwards.",

You will probably save more code by using createSlice vs manually writing a Provider.",

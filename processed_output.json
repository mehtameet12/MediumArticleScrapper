    "content": "Posted on Mar 11 Today, we’re excited to introduce Qodo Gen 1.0 to the community! Qodo Gen is an IDE-plugin that integrates intelligent agents for test and code generation, directly into your development environment. While many AI coding tools operate as simple command-response systems, Qodo Gen 1.0 represents the next generation: autonomous, multi-step problem-solving agents that work alongside you. Rather than just generating snippets, our agents understand your entire project context, can make decisions, use tools, and carry out tasks autonomously. Try Qodo Gen 1.0 Read on to learn about our new and updated features! Qodo Gen now supports either Standard or Agentic workflow modes. Standard mode offers a more manual Qodo Gen experience, including Commands. Agentic Mode makes interactions more dynamic and less structured, proactively assisting with tasks and providing contextual suggestions. The agentic chat is the evolution to multi-step problem-solving rather than one-shot AI responses. Qodo Gen’s agentic chat is autonomous in that instead of just writing code or answering a question just once, the chat agent can make decisions, ask questions, use tools and carry out tasks autonomously. The coding agent leverages core Qodo tools for understanding prompt intent and advanced context retrieval that include codebase indexing and analysis, web search and scraping. Here are some of the things the agent can do: This AI-powered conversational interface accelerates development while keeping you in control. In order to understand your code better and help you perform various actions, Agentic Mode uses multiple services behind the scenes. In addition to built-in servers, users can add their own external tools via Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP).  Users who have installed the MCP server can bring 3rd party or custom tools and agents to enhance their workflows by adding the API key. This extensibility ensures that Qodo Gen 1.0 seamlessly integrates into your development environment, allowing you to enhance workflows with both built-in capabilities and custom tools tailored to your needs. In previous versions of Qodo Gen, testing capabilities were carried out in a panel within the IDE. This advanced testing suite was dedicated to code behavior analysis, test behavior generation and test suite expansion. In Qodo Gen 1.0, users now have the option to use a chat-based, semi-agentic test generation workflow. Users can follow a step-by-step flow to add context, example tests and mocks, generate test behaviors and comprehensive test suites. This new workflow makes test generation more interactive and intuitive, allowing developers to collaborate with Qodo Gen 1.0 in refining, expanding, and optimizing their test suites with greater efficiency. Qodo Gen 1.0 is now available! Whether you're streamlining development, integrating AI-driven automation, or optimizing your test suite, Qodo has the tools to transform your workflow. Try Qodo Gen 1.0 Thanks for reading! Questions or comments? Leave them below.",

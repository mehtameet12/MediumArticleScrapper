It is worth noting, style is not something that is readily subject to copyright law. As AI models become more sophisticated, a new generative approach to style poses the potential for a massive (over-)production of culture. At the time of writing, for example, a new text-to-video model, Sora, has been hitting the headlines. It offers a glimpse into a potentially ‘memory-less’ future as foretold by postmodern theorists."

Following on from Duchamp’s earlier interventions, which gave attention to the wider context of an artwork, Warhol co-opted an ‘industrious’ mode, famously epitomised by his exhibiting of supermarket Brillo boxes in 1964. By turning the mass-produced object into a work of art, he challenged preconceived notions of the boundaries between art and the everyday. Had it been a problem confined to the artworld it might not have been so significant."

          "text": "Yet, Warhol’s legacy cuts more widely across culture. He came to epitomise the ability to affect style, i.e to engender a new capability to influence, change, or alter an existing style. This moves towards a postmodern reading. After Warhol, it was no longer necessary to create new utterances, but instead, it was possible (or only possible) to reframe, reposition and repackage what was already existing. Taken to its extreme, the argument is that there is no longer anything new, only new ways to contextualise and situate. Today, across the flood of Pinterest boards, Instagram feeds and TikTok and YouTube videos, we see the mass repetition of poses, filters and memes. Each are indubitably individual acts of creativity, yet arguably there is a paucity of originality. The ‘art’ is less in the generation of new meaning, and more in the curation, i.e the repurposing of images, texts and sound. We stylise and curate as a means to create."

The genre thrives on the reinterpretation and recontextualization of existing sounds, beats, and lyrics, making the act of remixing not just a method of creation but a statement of cultural and social significance. The skill of the rapper as a curator of sound becomes paramount, selecting and combining samples in ways that pay homage to their origins while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of musical expression. This practice reflects a postmodern appreciation for bricolage and intertextuality, where the meaning and value of the work are derived from its relationship to other texts and sounds. It is also worth noting, as rapper and professor Lupe Fiasco remarks, rap is intricately bound up in technological advancement. It is no real surprise that that relationship only further thrives on recent developments in AI. As part of his collaboration with Google, in developing the tool TextFx, Fiasco describes himself as a ‘data gathering machine’:"

          "text": "A scholarly reading of rap music typically focuses less on its entertainment and more its capacity for as rich, complex form of cultural and political expression. As part of wider remix culture, rap serves as a means of innovation and cultural critique, reflecting broader themes of resilience, identity and resistance. Tricia Rose, for example, a pioneering scholar of hip-hop culture, argues in her book Black Noise (1994), how the practice of sampling is not just an artistic technique but a method of cultural preservation and commentary. Similarly, in Yo’ Mama’s DisFunktional! (1998), historian Robin D. G. Kelley positions rap as a form of counter-narrative, pursued through the reassembly of existing musical fragments to forge new expressions of identity and resistance. In Prophets of the Hood: Politics and Poetics in Hip Hop (2004), Imani Perry charts the complexity of hip-hop as a cultural movement, taking rap to be emblematic of the foundational practice of ‘citationality,’ again suggestive of a practice of ‘style’ whereby references to existing cultural elements create layered meanings and commentaries on society, politics, and culture. Importantly, as Mark Anthony Neal argues in What the Music Said (1999), Black popular music styles play a key role in shaping Black public culture."

Nonetheless, as Hebdige argues there is a fundamental problem. While subcultural styles are inherently political — initially setting out to subvert mainstream norms and values — dominant cultural forms eventually co-opt these styles, diluting their subversive power and incorporating them into mainstream commercial culture. For example, the portrayal of punk as a treasured part of the national culture at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony is an overt example of such incorporation (in its heyday punk was seen as highly subversive and distinctly anti-establishment!)."

Artistic production arises out of a struggle with what has gone before, which in turn provides the ‘site’ upon which to make choices, as a means to seek change and freedom. In this sense, the assertion of ‘style’ provides a means to subvert or outwit the constraints of a dominant language. Sartre, for example, positioned the revered, bourgeois 19th century writer, Flaubert, as a writer embattled with his own (privileged) class identity, seeking to use literary style as a means of existential escape or critique. Flaubert’s critical portrayal of bourgeois society in his novel Madame Bovary is a case in point."

Importantly (albeit difficult to grasp), Barthes sought to distinguish between language and style with a third term, ‘writing’. His point was that both language and style are forms we inherit, i.e. we cannot choose them. We are born into a language, which is defining of a subject position. Style, while typically considered a means of individual expression, was similarly considered by Barthes as a means of defining one’s subject status. Style comes in many forms and does not readily possess a ‘grammar’, yet he viewed it an involuntary, embodied set of actions and affectations — some of which are indeed culturally shared habits — which crucially come prior to writing."

In a broader frame, theorist Achille Mbembe engages with concepts that contrast the calculable and the incalculable, or more specifically the politics of visibility and invisibility. His work prompts critical reflection on what can be quantified and what escapes quantification in social life and human experience. In the context of cultural styles and expressions, one could extrapolate from Mbembe’s perspective to argue that while certain aspects of culture might be measured or analyzed (the calculable), there are dimensions of human creativity, affect, and meaning that resist easy quantification or computational analysis (the incalculable)."

The packaging of styles and genres within easy-to-use filters, apps and softwares, appear to promote creativity, to provide very direct and intuitive means of cultural production, yet nonetheless provide a general repetition of styles, leading to a reduction in acts of choice or freedom (in Sartre’s sense). For example, the effortlessness in selecting a drum sound or post-production effects in Pro Tools — the industry standard for recording studios — is liberating in the immediate circumstance of making a track, yet betrays something of Barthes’ view of style as involuntary (as already coded)."

          "text": "In his essay, ‘The Grain of the Voice’, Barthes provides one way of understanding the incalculable. Writing about the reception of music (specifically the vocalist), he distinguishes between the ‘pheno-song’, which refers to aspects of performance that are culturally coded and communicable, and the ‘geno-song’, which represents the bodily, physical presence of the singer’s voice itself — or what he refers to as the ‘grain’. The grain is what Barthes identifies as the unique, irreducible quality of the voice, tied to the materiality of the body producing it."

It is how we tend to associate with the ‘signature’ of a specific artist; their unique character, which in turn provides unquantifiable nuances to how a song is sung. Arguably, there is a contradiction with Barthes’ earlier account of style as coded, and the grain of the voice as a bodily idiosyncratic, uncoded form. However, for the present purposes, the point is that there remains a ‘presence’ that cannot be quantified or copied. While this might seem a romantic view, Barthes’ maintains a structuralist account. The ‘geno-song’ is a part of an overal form, working in conjunction with the ‘pheno-song’. Crucially, it is a component that is not part of the communication of meaning (it does not draw upon the structure of language, for example; it is not the coded means of representing feelings or expression). In fact, the ‘geno-song’ or the ‘grain of the voice’ is just pure sound. It is the timbre of the individual vocalist — a form of friction or ‘noise’ — that we hear in addition to the meaning in a song."

By contrast, the words and melody of a song can be easily transmitted, transposed and ‘cited’.

Descript’s Overdub software, for example, allows users to clone their voice using AI, whereby users can then type text to be generated as audio in their voice. It is a technology used in correcting podcasts or video narration without need of re-recording.

It raises numerous philosophical questions about authenticity, creativity, and the essence of human expression in art, but nonetheless emerges as a real possibility and whereby the previous importance of ‘presence’ is no longer so critical. Beyond complex discussions about the nature of cultural production, concerns arise about saturation in the digital age. New technological capabilities pose a question as to whether there can be ‘too much culture’, i.e. the over-saturation of cultural production which we could never humanly consume."

In the case of the Warhol project, the system was allegedly trained on over 1,000 hours of audio data to create a realistic and authentic sounding voice for the artist.

The director, Andrew Rossi, was keen to adopt this more complex proccess in order to ‘fully appreciate the extreme sensitivity Andy reveals in his diaries’, arguing that we ‘needed to hear the words in Andy’s own voice’ (cited in Flora Roumpani’s ‘Lights, Camera, AI’)."

Copyright law primarily protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression, including literary, musical, dramatic, and artistic works, among others. The concept of ‘style’ is more abstract and generally refers to the distinct manner or technique an artist or creator uses in their work. Because style itself is a broad and often intangible set of characteristics, it is not directly protectable under copyright law as such."

This means that while you cannot copyright a style (e.g., impressionism, cubism, a specific genre of music, or manner of writing), the individual works produced in that style are protectable. Similarly, distinctive elements that are original and fixed in a tangible form within a work (such as a character’s unique appearance, a specific arrangement of music, or a particular graphic design) can be protected by copyright. Crucially, then, while copyright law protects the expression of ideas and tangible assets, it does not prevent others from creating works in the same style, provided they do not copy specific, copyrighted expressions of that style."

So, just as a tribute act is allowed to copy the style of a band or artist (as long as they secure permission to play the original songs), equally generative AI is technically able to reproduce styles ad infinitum. The tribute act, for example, is not purporting to be the original band — there is no sense in which they are passing themselves off as the original. By the same logic, this allows other artists to record their own versions of songs. They are allowed to adopt their own style, as long as they have permisssion to use the ‘idea’ of the original song. Yet, what emerges with generative AI (and deep learning calculation more broadly) is a whole new dimension to the question of style."

Of course, we might argue similar anxieties were expressed with the early developments of photography, yet ultimately this medium soon became a mainstay of artistic practice. OpenAI’s generative video platform, Sora, is not yet publicly available, but — at the time of writing — the company has given access to ‘visual artists, designers, creative directors, and filmmakers’ to gauge first impressions."

But, what is more impressive is the poetry of the film. It is a witty and provocative piece — an example of what it is that artists do best regardless of the medium. As shy kids’ Walter Woodman notes, ‘as great as Sora is at generating things that appear real, what excites us is its ability to make things that are totally surreal’. In other words, the artists are focused less on the technology, more on the work they want to make."

(1991), Bruno Latour challenged the idea of the separation between nature and culture, which had long been taken as a central narrative of modernity (e.g. the progress of science and technology in overcoming the natural world). This separation is a myth, he argued, with modernity actually representing the simultaneous purification of objects (through science and technology) and the proliferation of hybrid entities (which he calls ‘quasi-objects’ or ‘networks’; whereby the science is never without the social and cultural). Instead of seeing ourselves as modern by making an artificial separation, we should recognise the interconnectedness of humans, non-human entities, and technological artifacts in what Latour termed the ‘Parliament of Things’. Importantly, his account was a critique of postmodern discourse, charging postmodern philosophers (such as Lyotard and Baudrillard, but also thinkers such as Barthes, Lacan, and Derrida) with the view that ‘their thinking simply revolved around artificial “sign-worlds;” [hence] he challenged them with the provocative statement that “we have never been modern.’"

In other words, what if the ability to grasp the world of signs at the end of the twentieth century (at the time the postmodern philosophers produced their iconic works) was vastly insufficient to truly comprehend and respond to both the idea of Latour’s hybrid entities and postmodernist views on relativism, fragmentation, simulation and the ‘death of the author’? What if, it is only now we are starting to gain insights into the massively calculable ‘world’ of things, signs and styles that have always persisted, if only outside of our scope of visibility? We might consider the emerging ‘techniques’ of generative AI, along with the internet, big data, and other digital technologies, to usher in a new era that transcends (and makes newly mallaeable) postmodernism’s skepticism and relativism. This era could be characterized by a new form of realism or another philosophical stance that acknowledges the profound impact of technology on our understanding of truth, reality, and human identity. It might suggest that the distinctions postmodernism challenged between high and low culture, or between the author and the reader, were in fact only minor considerations in an increasingly irreverent world in which algorithms produce art, literature, and music, which in turn challenges not only our notions of creativity and originality, but in fact the very space and time of making art."
